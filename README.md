ðŸ“Š Data Analysis and Visualization

Welcome to my Data Analysis and Visualization repository!
This repo contains various lab assignments, projects, and experiments related to data preprocessing, machine learning models, clustering techniques, NLP tasks, and visualization using Python and popular libraries like pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, and more.

ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s Inside?

ðŸ”¸ Supervised Learning
svm_and_custom_functions.py
Includes custom Python functions and SVM implementation using sklearn.
logistic_regression_iris.py
Data preprocessing and logistic regression on the Iris dataset. Handles outliers, encodes target, and evaluates model performance.
ðŸ”¸ Clustering
clustering_kmeans_dbscan.py
Demonstrates customer segmentation using KMeans and synthetic data clustering using DBSCAN with visual outputs.
ðŸ”¸ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
nlp_bigram_model/nlp_bigram_model.py
(Coming soon or already added) Contains a model that analyzes word pair frequencies using bigrams for NLP-related tasks.
ðŸ”¸ Hadoop and MapReduce (with MRJob)
mrjob_text_analysis.py
Performs line, word, and character count analysis on text data using the MRJob library for MapReduce-style processing.
ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Install required Python libraries before running any scripts:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn mrjob
ðŸ“‚ Datasets

Some scripts rely on external datasets like:

Mall_Customers.csv
Iris.csv
text file.txt
